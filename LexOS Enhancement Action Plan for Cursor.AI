# LexOS Enhancement Action Plan for Cursor.AI

**Mission Briefing:** Evolve LexOS into a world-class, autonomous agent system using open-source and low-cost technologies, following a prioritized, step-by-step implementation plan.

**Guiding Principles:**
- **Zero-Budget Focus:** Prioritize free, open-source solutions and leverage existing infrastructure.
- **Incremental Development:** Implement features in phases, validating each step.
- **Documentation First:** Ensure clear documentation precedes implementation.
- **Community Support:** Select technologies with active communities.

## Phase 1: Core AI Foundation & Development Environment (Priority 1)

### Step 1.1: Setup Local Development Environment (Docker Compose)
- **Goal:** Create a consistent local development environment mirroring production.
- **Action (Cursor.AI):**
  - Create a `docker-compose.yml` file at the project root.
  - Define services for the backend (e.g., FastAPI/Django), frontend (e.g., Node.js for build), database (PostgreSQL), and vector database (PostgreSQL with pgvector).
  - Configure volumes for persistent data and code mounting.
  - Add network configurations for inter-service communication.
  - Write setup instructions in `README.md` for developers.
- **Validation:** Developers can run `docker-compose up -d` to bring up the entire stack locally.

### Step 1.2: Integrate Vector Database (PostgreSQL + pgvector)
- **Goal:** Enable semantic search and similarity matching capabilities.
- **Action (Cursor.AI):**
  - **Database Setup:**
    - Ensure the PostgreSQL service in `docker-compose.yml` includes the `pgvector` extension. Use an image that supports it (e.g., `ankane/pgvector` or build custom).
    - Add SQL command to enable the extension: `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;` (run during initialization or manually).
  - **Backend Integration:**
    - Update backend code (e.g., Python service) to connect to the PostgreSQL database.
    - Install necessary libraries (e.g., `psycopg2-binary`, `sqlalchemy`, `pgvector` Python library).
    - Modify data models to include `vector` type columns for embeddings.
    - Implement functions for storing and querying vector embeddings using appropriate indexing (e.g., HNSW, IVFFlat).
- **Validation:** Backend service can successfully store and retrieve vector data from the local PostgreSQL instance.

### Step 1.3: Integrate AI Agent Framework (LangChain)
- **Goal:** Implement a robust framework for building LLM-powered agent logic.
- **Action (Cursor.AI):**
  - **Backend Integration:**
    - Add `langchain` and related libraries (e.g., `langchain-openai`, `langchain-community`) to backend dependencies (`requirements.txt`).
    - Refactor existing AI/ML logic or create new modules using LangChain components (Chains, Agents, Tools, Memory).
    - Integrate LangChain with the vector database (Step 1.2) for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) capabilities.
    - Define custom tools for LexOS-specific actions (e.g., communication APIs, scheduling).
    - Implement agent executors (e.g., `AgentExecutor`) to run autonomous tasks.
- **Validation:** Basic agent tasks (e.g., answering questions using RAG, executing a simple tool) can be performed via API calls to the backend.

## Phase 2: Cost Reduction & Security Hardening (Priority 2)

### Step 2.1: Implement Self-Hosted Communication Stack
- **Goal:** Replace Twilio with open-source/low-cost alternatives.
- **Action (Cursor.AI):**
  - **Email:**
    - Set up a self-hosted email server (e.g., Poste.io, Mail-in-a-Box) or use a low-cost provider with SMTP/IMAP access.
    - Integrate Python libraries (`smtplib`, `imaplib`) into the backend service for sending/receiving emails.
  - **SMS:**
    - Research and integrate with an open-source SMS gateway (e.g., Kannel) or a low-cost SMS API provider (check alternatives identified in research).
    - Implement backend service logic for sending/receiving SMS via the chosen gateway/API.
  - **Voice/Video:**
    - Implement WebRTC capabilities in the frontend and backend.
    - Use libraries like `aiortc` (Python) for backend signaling and media handling.
    - Explore open-source signaling servers if needed.
- **Validation:** LexOS can send/receive emails, SMS, and initiate basic WebRTC calls via API endpoints.

### Step 2.2: Implement Enhanced Security Layer (HashiCorp Vault)
- **Goal:** Securely manage secrets and API keys.
- **Action (Cursor.AI):**
  - **Setup Vault:**
    - Add a HashiCorp Vault service to `docker-compose.yml` for local development.
    - For production, plan deployment of Vault (e.g., dedicated instance, managed service if budget allows later).
  - **Backend Integration:**
    - Add Vault client library (e.g., `hvac` for Python) to backend dependencies.
    - Modify backend services to retrieve secrets (API keys, database passwords) from Vault instead of environment variables or config files.
    - Implement appropriate Vault authentication methods (e.g., AppRole).
- **Validation:** Backend services successfully retrieve secrets from Vault during startup and operation.

### Step 2.3: Optimize GPU Usage / Explore Alternatives
- **Goal:** Reduce reliance on potentially expensive dedicated GPU compute.
- **Action (Cursor.AI):**
  - **Analysis:** Profile current AI/ML models to identify tasks suitable for CPU inference.
  - **Optimization:** Implement CPU-based inference for identified models using libraries like ONNX Runtime or optimized framework versions.
  - **Research Serverless:** Investigate serverless GPU/AI platforms (e.g., AWS SageMaker Serverless Inference, Google Cloud Functions with GPU) as potential future low-cost alternatives for specific tasks.
- **Validation:** Key AI tasks can run efficiently on CPU or cost-effective serverless options without significant performance degradation.

## Phase 3: Performance & User Experience (Priority 3)

### Step 3.1: Implement Monitoring & Observability (Prometheus + Grafana)
- **Goal:** Gain visibility into system performance and health.
- **Action (Cursor.AI):**
  - **Setup:**
    - Add Prometheus and Grafana services to `docker-compose.yml`.
    - Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from backend services (requires exposing metrics endpoints, e.g., using `prometheus-fastapi-instrumentator` or similar).
    - Configure Grafana with Prometheus as a data source.
  - **Dashboards:** Create basic Grafana dashboards to visualize key metrics (request latency, error rates, resource usage).
- **Validation:** Metrics from backend services are visible in Grafana dashboards.

### Step 3.2: Evaluate Frontend Performance Optimization (Svelte)
- **Goal:** Improve frontend load times and responsiveness.
- **Action (Cursor.AI):**
  - **Pilot Project:** Rebuild a small, non-critical part of the frontend using Svelte or SvelteKit.
  - **Comparison:** Compare bundle size, load times, and developer experience against the existing React/Next.js implementation.
  - **Decision:** Based on the pilot, decide whether to incrementally adopt Svelte for new features or refactor existing ones.
- **Validation:** Measurable improvements in bundle size and/or performance metrics for the pilot component.

### Step 3.3: Evaluate Backend Scalability (Phoenix - Optional/Long-term)
- **Goal:** Improve handling of high-concurrency tasks (e.g., real-time communication).
- **Action (Cursor.AI):**
  - **Research:** Conduct a deeper dive into Phoenix and Elixir for specific high-concurrency use cases within LexOS.
  - **Pilot (Optional):** If a clear need is identified, build a proof-of-concept microservice using Phoenix for a specific feature (e.g., WebSocket handling).
  - **Decision:** Determine feasibility and benefit of introducing another language/framework to the stack.
- **Validation:** Proof-of-concept demonstrates significant performance/scalability benefits for the targeted use case.

## Phase 4: Advanced Features & Integration (Priority 4)

### Step 4.1: Implement Data Integration (Airbyte)
- **Goal:** Streamline data flow between LexOS and external sources.
- **Action (Cursor.AI):**
  - **Setup:** Deploy Airbyte (e.g., via Docker).
  - **Configure Pipelines:** Set up Airbyte connectors and pipelines to sync data between relevant sources/destinations (e.g., external APIs, databases).
  - **Backend Integration:** Modify backend services to utilize data synced via Airbyte where necessary.
- **Validation:** Data is successfully synced between configured sources and destinations.

### Step 4.2: Implement Multi-Agent Orchestration (CrewAI)
- **Goal:** Enable complex workflows involving multiple specialized AI agents.
- **Action (Cursor.AI):**
  - **Backend Integration:**
    - Add `crewai` library to backend dependencies.
    - Design and implement multi-agent crews using CrewAI's concepts (Agents, Tasks, Tools, Process).
    - Integrate CrewAI with LangChain tools and agents.
- **Validation:** A sample multi-agent task (e.g., research topic -> write summary -> draft email) can be executed successfully.

### Step 4.3: Implement Low-Code Agent Interface (Langflow)
- **Goal:** Provide a visual interface for designing and testing agent workflows.
- **Action (Cursor.AI):**
  - **Setup:** Deploy Langflow (e.g., via Docker).
  - **Integration:** Connect Langflow to the backend services/APIs and vector database.
  - **Workflow Design:** Use Langflow's UI to visually build and test LangChain/agent flows.
