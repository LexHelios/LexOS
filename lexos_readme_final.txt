## 🛠️ **DEVELOPMENT & CUSTOMIZATION**

### Service Development
Each consciousness service is independently deployable:

```bash
# Edit service code
cd services/consciousness-memory
# Modify main.py

# Restart specific service  
docker-compose restart consciousness-memory

# View service logs
docker-compose logs -f consciousness-memory
```

### Adding New Capabilities
1. Create new service directory in `services/`
2. Implement FastAPI application
3. Add to `docker-compose.yml`
4. Update API gateway routing
5. Deploy with `make restart`

### Frontend Customization
```bash
# Edit React components
cd frontend/src/components
# Modify ConsciousnessInterface.js, FinancialDashboard.js, etc.

# Restart frontend
docker-compose restart frontend
```

## 🚨 **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### Common Issues

**Port Conflicts:**
```bash
# Check port usage
lsof -i :3000
lsof -i :8000

# Change ports in docker-compose.yml if needed
```

**Memory Issues:**
```bash
# Check Docker memory usage
docker stats

# Increase Docker memory limit in Docker Desktop settings
```

**Database Connection Issues:**
```bash
# Check database status
docker-compose exec postgres pg_isready

# Reset database
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up -d postgres
make init
```

**Service Won't Start:**
```bash
# Check service logs
docker-compose logs [service-name]

# Rebuild service
docker-compose build [service-name]
docker-compose up -d [service-name]
```

### Emergency Recovery
```bash
# Complete system reset
make clean
make build  
make init
make up

# Backup consciousness data first
docker-compose exec postgres pg_dump -U lexos_admin lexos_consciousness > backup.sql
```
